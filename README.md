# yala
Yet Another Log Analyzer

# installation

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aogburn/yala/main/yala.sh

# updating 

When run, yala will look for a new version to use and update itself with a simple wget if so.  Uncomment the CHECK_UPDATE flag in the script if you need to disable those update checks. The script may be updated over time with new helpful checks, stats, or known issue searches.

# usage

* To run:
> ./yatda.sh -f thread-dump-file-name
